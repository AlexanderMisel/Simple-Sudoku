Simple-Sudoku
=============

A simple implementation of a sudoku game

This sudoku is written based on bitwise operations. The solver uses backtracking after a series of logic eliminations. And the generator is simply digging holes from a randomized complete sudoku board. I used C++ to write them. And, currently, it is all inside the sudoku.cpp file.
